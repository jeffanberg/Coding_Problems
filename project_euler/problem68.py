Magic 5-gon ring
https://projecteuler.net/problem=68

By concatenating each group it is possible to form 9-digit strings;
the maximum string for a 3-gon ring is 432621513.

Using the numbers 1 to 10, and depending on arrangements,
it is possible to form 16- and 17-digit strings.
What is the maximum 16-digit string for a "magic" 5-gon ring?
